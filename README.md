# TaskWeb

TaskWeb is a simple React application that helps you manage your tasks. It features three main components:

- **FilterButtons:** A set of toggle buttons that allow you to filter tasks by "All," "Completed," and "Uncompleted" statuses.
- **AddTask:** A component that lets you add a new task by providing a name and description, with the task data being saved to local storage.
- **QuoteBox:** A footer component that displays a random quote fetched from an external API, offering a little inspiration each time you use the app.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Easily add new tasks with a name and description. Tasks are stored in local storage, ensuring they persist between sessions.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Use large, centered toggle buttons to filter tasks based on their completion status.
- **Random Quotes:** Get inspired with a random quote displayed in the footer. The quote is fetched from an external API on each page load.
- **Bootstrap Integration:** Leverages Bootstrap classes for a clean and responsive design.
